# online-shop-project
This is a NodeJS/Express web application with vanilla JS on the front-end. It was made during the "100 days of coding" udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
### Deployment
The application has been deployed and can be viewed <ins>**[here.](https://online-shop-project375.herokuapp.com/)**</ins> You can also try to deploy it on your own. In the project folder you can find a __.env.example__ file which has all environment variables and short explaination on what they should be set as.  <br/> <br/>
For the purpose of testing I am providing an admin account, which will allow you to create/delete new products and manage orders. You will also be allowed to create your own user account, however admin privileges won't be present. <br/>
